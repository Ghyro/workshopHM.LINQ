## Tasks. Do not use extension methods!

1. Issue a list of all customers whose total turnover (the sum of all orders) exceeds some value X. Demonstrate the execution of a query with different X (think whether you can do without copying the query several times)

2. For each customer, make a list of suppliers located in the same country and the same city. Do tasks using grouping and without.

3. Find all customers who have orders that exceed the sum of X

4. Issue a list of customers with an indication of the beginning of which month of which year they became customers (to accept the month and year of the first order as such)

5. Do the previous task, but give the list sorted by year, month, customer turnovers (from maximum to minimum) and customer name

6. Indicate all customers who have a non-numeric postal code or a region is empty or the operator code is not specified in the phone (for simplicity, we assume that this is equivalent to “no round brackets at the beginning”).

7. Group all products into categories, inside - by stock availability, within the last group, sort by cost.

8. Group products into groups of "cheap", "average price", "expensive". Define the boundaries of each group

9. Calculate the average profitability of each city (average order amount for all customers from this city) and average intensity (average number of orders per customer from each city)

10. Make the average annual activity statistics of customers by months (excluding the year), statistics by year, by year and month (that is, when one month in different years has its own value).
